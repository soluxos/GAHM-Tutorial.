##Project Plan
Please find the project plan outlined [here](https://github.com/MADAMULLAC/GAHM/blob/master/ProjectPlan.md "Project Plan")

## Prerequisites
- GNU Autotools (2.4.6)
- OpenGL 3.0+
- C++11 compiler (tested with GCC 4.8.3+)
- [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
- [GLM](http://glm.g-truc.net/)
- Unix like command line (terminal, cygwin, etcâ€¦) to run makefile

## How to get dependencies.

### Fedora, RedHat, Other Yum package manager based OS's


To get the dependencies assuming you have a fresh install of the latest version, simply run the following command:

> $ yum install libtool boost-* glew-devel glfw glm-devel gcc-c++

*Don't include the $ sign*

### OSx

*To run simply open the project file via xCode on OSX.*

To get the above packages I would recommend using [brew](http://brew.sh/) and [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) as these will do all the package management for you; both are fairly simple to install by following the simple instructions on their relevant websites.
Once again ensure you have the above packages included. 

> $ brew install autoconf automake libtool boost glfw glm 

> $ sudo port install glm

*ONCE AGAIN; Don't include the $ sign*

By installing macport that should suffice for other requirements.

You will also need xCode installed as this will include dependencies required by the game.

### Windows

*The Makefile for windows is still under development!*

You will need to install [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) and include the dependencies listed above during the install stage.
If you do not have those packages and already have cygwin installed; simply re-run the installer and include the packages as before and cygwin will install them.

Please note, that GLM and glew are still not being linked and the makefile is still under development. Windows will hopefully be completed soon.

### Build and run

Then from the game root directory run the following commands:

``` bash
$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
$ make
```

This will produce an executable in the src directory called "shaderexample"; to run execute the game use
> $ ./src/shaderexample

*IF IT WASN'T ALREADY CLEAR FROM ABOVE, ONCE AGAIN! Don't include the $ sign*

## Aim of the game

NOBODY KNOWS!
