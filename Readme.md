##Original Project Plan
Please find the project plan outlined [here](https://github.com/MADAMULLAC/GAHM/blob/master/ProjectPlan.md "Project Plan")

## Prerequisites
- GNU Autotools (2.4.6)
- OpenGL 3.0+
- C++11 compiler (tested with GCC 4.8.3+)
- [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
- [GLM](http://glm.g-truc.net/)
- [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/download.html)
- Unix like command line (terminal, cygwin, etcâ€¦) to run makefile

## How to get dependencies.

### Fedora, RedHat, Other Yum package manager based OS's


To get the dependencies assuming you have a fresh install of the latest version, simply run the following command:

> $ yum install libtool boost-* glew-devel glfw glm-devel gcc-c++

*Don't include the $ sign*

### OSx

*To run simply open the project file via xCode on OSX.*

To get the above packages I would recommend using [brew](http://brew.sh/) and [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) as these will do all the package management for you; both are fairly simple to install by following the simple instructions on their relevant websites.
Once again ensure you have the above packages included. 

> $ brew install autoconf automake libtool boost glfw glm 

> $ sudo port install glm

*ONCE AGAIN; Don't include the $ sign*

By installing macport that should suffice for other requirements.

You will also need xCode installed as this will include dependencies required by the game.

### Windows

*The file should work via monoDevelop with all the prerequisites*

## Aim of the game

The aim of the game is really to enjoy the scenery and float about, whilst you ponder life's decisions. You must also wonder why you haven't ever had the chance to play with something so magnificent in your life. The game is going to be one of the most magical things to play as it's all what's going on in your imagination that counts. 

## Funding

If you really enjoyed the game, because we all know that you did then we are going to be setting up a kickstarter for the next installment of this game, which will be known as "GAHM 2 - Blockier than ever."
